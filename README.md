# NBA-Database


Project Introduction â€“

This project, the NBA Basketball Database, was developed for COMP 3380 and is an interactive interface to manage and query an NBA database. The database includes extensive information about games, players, teams, officials, and different statistics about the games. This project was in collaboration with my peers Josh, Jacob, and Sahil, who were a great help in the design, implementation, and testing of the system. It allows analysts and enthusiasts to fetch actionable insights about NBA games and players through an easy-to-use console interface. It has an intuitive and user-friendly interface that allows users to ask interesting queries with ease. This system ensures security against SQL injection attacks by parameterizing the queries, thereby improving the overall reliability and safety. Finding data for your favorite players, teams, and games will only take a few moments.
